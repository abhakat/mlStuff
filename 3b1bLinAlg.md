# Chapter 1

## Perspectives of Vectors
Physics: Magnitude + Direction
CS: Ordered lists of numbers
Mathmatician: more abstract
    * operations are important

* Coordinates:
  * are a pair of vectors that direct you how far to walk to get to a certain point

* Vector Operations: 
  * to add vectors we need to move the separate one, from the tip of the first one to the tail of the second one
  * when multiplying, we stretch/squish a vector and this is called scaling, we call nubmers that modify vectors as "scalar"

# Chapter 2
* When you have a pair of numbers, you need to think of each number as a scalar
* the basis vectors i hat x direciton, j hat y direction
* the vectors that coordinates describe are two scaled vectors 
* you can reach every possible two dimension vector using the basis vectors
  * you can change the basis vector and still usually represent the entoire space
  * the basis vectors determien 
* av + bw = linear combinartion of 2 vectors
* for most pairs of vectors, you can reach every possible two dimenions
* the "span" is the set of all possible vectors you can reach from a bcombination of 2 vectors is known as the span
  * the span of most 2d vectors, and when they line up, the span is just the vectors that sit on the line.
  * the span is aksing, whch vectors you can reach usuling scalar multiplicaiton and vector addition.
* Span is more interesting in 3d space,the span of 2 3d vectosr is all the posssible linear combinations you get by adding all of them tgother
  * this will trace out a flat sheet, the 2 vectors whose tips are respent this flat sheet
* now with 3d vectors, the span is the set of all possible linear combinations, and if the third vector doesn't sit on the span of hte first 2, we get access to very possible 3d vector
* v and w are linearly dependent, one u = av + bw means u is linearly depndent
  * if two vectors add another dimension to the span, they are said to be linearly independent u != av + bw
* the basis is a set of linearly independent vectors which span this space

# Part 1
A neural network is a very popular algorithm for machine learing.
* neural network can fix to a varied dataset
* a neural network is a set of 
* parameter estiamtes are analogous to when we fit a straight line to data
* we start with unknown parameter values athat are estimated when we fit a neural network to a dataset
* curved line is called softplus
* bentlines are called ReLus, rectified learning unit
* sigmoid shape or any other bent or curevd line
* curved or bent liens are called activation functions
* when you build a neural network you have to decide what activation function you want to use
* in practice it is much more common to use the ReLU activation fucntion(soft plus activation function)
* usually nueral netowrks have multiple layers between input and output nodes
* layers between input and output nodes are called hidden layers
* you decide how many hidden layers you want 
* neural networks uses curved/bent lines in hidden layer and adds them together to get a curve that fits the data
* function to get input to soft plus function
